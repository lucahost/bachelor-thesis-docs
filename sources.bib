  abstract     = {Biological network analysis is a powerful approach to gain systems-level understanding of patterns of gene expression in different cell types, disease states and other biological/experimental conditions. Three consecutive steps are required - identification of genes or proteins of interest, network construction and network analysis and visualization. To date, researchers have to learn to use a combination of several tools to accomplish this task. In addition, interactive visualization of large networks has been primarily restricted to locally installed programs. To address these challenges, we have developed {NetworkAnalyst}, taking advantage of state-of-the-art web technologies, to enable high performance network analysis with rich user experience. {NetworkAnalyst} integrates all three steps and presents the results via a powerful online network visualization framework. Users can upload gene or protein lists, single or multiple gene expression datasets to perform comprehensive gene annotation and differential expression analysis. Significant genes are mapped to our manually curated protein-protein interaction database to construct relevant networks. The results are presented through standard web browsers for network analysis and interactive exploration. {NetworkAnalyst} supports common functions for network topology and module analyses. Users can easily search, zoom and highlight nodes or modules, as well as perform functional enrichment analysis on these selections. The networks can be customized with different layouts, colors or node sizes, and exported as {PNG}, {PDF} or {GraphML} files. Comprehensive {FAQs}, tutorials and context-based tips and instructions are provided. {NetworkAnalyst} currently supports protein-protein interaction network analysis for human and mouse and is freely available at http://www.networkanalyst.ca.},

Throughout the development and progression of {AD}, over 90\% of patients display behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia ({BPSD}), with some of these symptoms occurring before memory deficits and therefore serving as potential early predictors of {AD}-related cognitive decline. However, the biochemical links between {AD} and {BPSD} are not known. In this study, we explored the molecular interactions between {AD} and {BPSD} using protein-protein interaction ({PPI}) networks built from {OMIM} (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man) genes that were related to {AD} and two distinct {BPSD} domains, the Affective Domain and the Hyperactivity, Impulsivity, Disinhibition, and Aggression ({HIDA}) Domain. Our results yielded 8 unique proteins for the Affective Domain ({RHOA}, {GRB}2, {PIK}3R1, {HSPA}4, {HSP}90AA1, {GSK}3beta, {PRKCZ}, and {FYN}), 5 unique proteins for the {HIDA} Domain ({LRP}1, {EGFR}, {YWHAB}, {SUMO}1, and {EGR}1), and 6 shared proteins between both {BPSD} domains ({APP}, {UBC}, {ELAV}1, {YWHAZ}, {YWHAE}, and {SRC}) and {AD}. These proteins might suggest specific targets and pathways that are involved in the pathogenesis of these {BPSD} domains in {AD}.},

In the discussion of the results, it is shown that for some {TIs} regularities exist in the dependence of {EFTI} values upon the branching of fragment F, or upon the marginal versus central position of the fragment F in the graph G. New vortex invariants can be computed as {EFTI} values for one-atom fragments over all graph vertices; by iteration, it is in principle possible to devise an infinite number of now vertex invariants.},

Another major contribution of this paper is the investigation of relationships between graph entropies.

In this paper, we extend the debate in the literature to find useful properties of structural graph measures. For this, we investigate the usefulness of topological indices for graphs quantitatively by assigning a feature vector to graph that contains ‘useful’ properties represented by certain measures. We show examples and compare the usefulness by using this apparatus based on distance measures and on a agglomerative clustering task.},

Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks ‘rewired’ to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them ‘small-world’ networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon13,14 (popularly known as six degrees of separation15). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

Genes associated with similar disorders show both higher likelihood of physical interactions between their products and higher expression profiling similarity for their transcripts, supporting the existence of distinct disease-specific functional modules. We find that essential human genes are likely to encode hub proteins and are expressed widely in most tissues. This suggests that disease genes also would play a central role in the human interactome. In contrast, we find that the vast majority of disease genes are nonessential and show no tendency to encode hub proteins, and their expression pattern indicates that they are localized in the functional periphery of the network. A selection-based model explains the observed difference between essential and disease genes and also suggests that diseases caused by somatic mutations should not be peripheral, a prediction we confirm for cancer genes.},

  abstract = {Ecosystems, and particularly, food webs have been subject of many studies in the last years. This is a 
              hot topic if we consider the anthropogenic pressures and modifications that are increasingly prominent 
              and notorious nowadays. Theoretical biologists try to figure out, in predictive analyses, how ecosystems 
              will react if a species suddenly disappears. These analyses are often supported by a variety of different 
              mathematical tools. Different mathematical tools are intended to give different biological answers.
              In fact, food webs are usually complex relationships of interactions and thus, it is very common, 
              in any systems ecology work, to simplify these interactions. A common way to do it is to reduce the 
              system under focus to a network form. In network representation, we usually have entities connected by 
              links. These links can be weighted, directed, looped, and thus, allow us to add some detail to the analysis. 
              In biology, a food web can also be depicted as a network: species or groups of species are depicted as 
              entities and their trophic interactions are depicted as links.
              In general network analysis, there are a myriad of different centrality indices. Centrality indices 
              allow us to identify the critical nodes in a network. In ecology these indices are also used and have been 
              suggested to identify key organisms and to quantify their importance in food webs. All of these indices 
              provide some information related to the centrality of a node in a network, but each of them is different. 
              They express different aspects of being in the centre. Their relationships and also their biological 
              meanings are often unclear.
              Another common way to evaluate the importance of a species to the food web is through 
              dynamical simulations of system behaviour. We can test, based in mathematical expressions such as 
              logistic models, how the whole system will behave, i.e., how all the species will react if we take one 
              species almost to its extinction.
              This dissertation will analyse the correlation between centrality indices and the outcome of 
              dynamical simulations, namely, community responses. The assumption is that the disturbance of more 
              central species will generate larger community responses in the system. The goal is to understand if 
              centrality indices are good enough to make predictions (closer to the ones we can get performing 
              community response simulations). It is a major challenge to use simpler structural indicators to predict 
              the outcome of much more complicated simulations. We approach these goals by using machine learning 
              techniques to combine k centrality indices out of n in such a way that the correlation between the 
              structural node centrality rank and the simulated node importance rank is the strongest. We ask which 
              centrality indices should be chosen and how exactly they should be combined to best predict simulated 
              food web dynamics. We also evaluate to what extent these correlations can be improved},

The interactions can be even more important than the species themselves for understanding how the whole system is functioning and organized. For the representation of the topological space of interspecific relationships, graph theory is a suitable mathematical tool: the network perspective and the various techniques of network analysis are more and more elaborated and invading ecology. Beyond a static view on networks, fundamental questions can only be answered if dynamical analyses are also made, and now it is clear that structural and dynamical studies must not “compete” but strongly complement each other. Our aim is to give a menu of classical and more recently suggested network indices and to discuss what do we know about their relations to ecosystem dynamics. Since ecologists have very diverse problems, they need diverse techniques and a good insight in matching the adequate method to a particular problem. The main question is how to link certain graph properties to understanding and predicting the behaviour of an ecosystem. We wish to contribute to bridging the gap between extreme structural and extreme dynamical views.},

Mathematical chemistry is an area of mathematics that employs mathematical methods to tackle chemical-related problems. A graphical representation of chemical molecules, known as the molecular graph of the chemical substance, is one of these tools. A topological index ({TI}) is a mathematical function that assigns a numerical value to a (molecular) graph and predicts many physical, chemical, biological, thermodynamical, and structural features of that network. In this work, we calculate a new topological index namely, the Sombor index, the Super Sombor index, and its reduced version for chemical networks. We also plot our computed results to examine how they were affected by the parameters involved. This document lists the distinct degrees and degree sums of enhanced mesh network, triangular mesh network, star of silicate network, and rhenium trioxide lattice. The edge partitions of these families of networks are tabled which depend on the sum of degrees of end vertices and the sum of the degree-based edges. These edge partitions are used to find closed formulae for numerous degree-based topological indices of the networks.},

  abstract     = {At least two different approaches have been used to quantitatively assess the importance of species in communities. One approach is to derive relatively simple, structural importance indices from network analysis. This assumes that well-connected species are more important. Another approach is to derive functional importance indices using dynamical simulations. We performed both kinds of analysis, and we ranked the species of the Prince William Sound food web based on 13 structural and 5 functional importance indices. We then compared the rank correlation between structural and functional indices. Our results show that different approaches to quantifying importance give different results; unweighted structural indices never correlate significantly with functional ones, but certain weighted structural indices correlate reasonably well with simulated function. This line of research could help in improving our understanding of the usefulness of structural approaches in quantifying the importance of species and understanding biological communities in general. The results strongly indicate the fundamental importance of indirect effects in governing ecosystem dynamics and the need to account for them in structural approaches. Conversely, it generally verifies the usefulness of functional approaches to the investigation of biological communities that account for indirect effects, whether they are modelling or direct empirical studies.},

  abstract     = {Conservation biology should focus more on the importance rather than the rarity of species, although the definition and quantification of importance are not easy. One approach involves measuring the positional importance (e.g. centrality) of species in ecological interaction networks to provide a basis for species ranking. However, there are many centrality indices, each reflecting a particular aspect of positional importance and therefore giving a rank order of species different from those provided by alternative formulations. Thus, there is a strong need for comparing the available indices and for examining their relative merits in network analysis. In this paper, we apply 13 centrality indices to the “species” (trophic components) of methodologically comparable trophic flow networks, in order to answer the following questions: (1) What is the disagreement between different indices regarding the rank of a given species in a given network? (2) How is this disagreement in performance influenced by the choice of the network? (3) What is the overall relationship among these indices and, in particular, which are the most similar to degree (the simplest index of all, being equal to the number of links pertaining to a given node)? We compare the 13 indices based on the data of nine networks using metric and rank statistics and multivariate analysis procedures. We conclude that (1) different centrality ranks differ in each network; (2) different webs can be characterized by different relationships between ranks but there is a robust pattern of relationships among the indices, some index pairs behaving very similarly in all networks; and (3) it is the index of closeness centrality which provides a rank most similar to that based on degree.},

While these techniques provide high accuracy, they are often designed using heuristics that leverage domain-specific properties of the workload or hardware. In this vision paper, we argue that many data center networking techniques, e.g., routing, topology augmentation, energy savings, with diverse goals share design and architectural similarities. We present a framework for developing general intermediate representations of network topologies using deep learning that is amenable to solving a large class of data center problems. We develop a framework, {DeepConf}, that simplifies the process of configuring and training deep learning agents by using our intermediate representation to learn different tasks. To illustrate the strength of our approach, we implemented and evaluated a {DeepConf}-agent that tackles the data center topology augmentation problem. Our initial results are promising --- {DeepConf} performs comparably to the optimal solution.},

This article presents a survey of such measurements. It includes general considerations about complex network characterization, a brief review of the principal models, and the presentation of the main existing measurements. Important related issues covered in this work comprise the representation of the evolution of complex networks in terms of trajectories in several measurement spaces, the analysis of the correlations between some of the most traditional measurements, perturbation analysis, as well as the use of multivariate statistics for feature selection and network classification. Depending on the network and the analysis task one has in mind, a specific set of features may be chosen. It is hoped that the present survey will help the proper application and interpretation of measurements.},

Growing evidence in recent studies suggests that cancer can be better understood through mutated or dysregulated pathways or networks rather than individual mutations and that the efficacy of repositioned drugs can be inferred from disease modules in molecular networks. This article reviews network-based machine learning and graph theory algorithms for integrative analysis of personal genomic data and biomedical knowledge bases to identify tumor-specific molecular mechanisms, candidate targets and repositioned drugs for personalized treatment. The review focuses on the algorithmic design and mathematical formulation of these methods to facilitate applications and implementations of network-based analysis in the practice of precision oncology. We review the methods applied in three scenarios to integrate genomic data and network models in different analysis pipelines, and we examine three categories of network-based approaches for repositioning drugs in drugdiseasegene networks. In addition, we perform a comprehensive subnetwork/pathway analysis of mutations in 31 cancer genome projects in the Cancer Genome Atlas and present a detailed case study on ovarian cancer. Finally, we discuss interesting observations, potential pitfalls and future directions in network-based precision oncology.},

  shorttitle = {Sparsity Measure of a Network Graph},
  abstract   = {This article examines the application of a popular measure of sparsity, Gini Index, on network graphs. A wide variety of network graphs happen to be sparse. But the index with which sparsity is commonly measured in network graphs is edge density, reflecting the proportion of the sum of the degrees of all nodes in the graph compared to the total possible degrees in the corresponding fully connected graph. Thus edge density is a simple ratio and carries limitations, primarily in terms of the amount of information it takes into account in its definition. In this paper, we have provided a formulation for defining sparsity of a network graph by generalizing the concept of Gini Index and call it sparsity index. A majority of the six properties (viz., Robin Hood, Scaling, Rising Tide, Cloning, Bill Gates and Babies) with which sparsity measures are commonly compared are seen to be satisfied by the proposed index. A comparison between edge density and the sparsity index has been drawn with appropriate examples to highlight the efficacy of the proposed index. It has also been shown theoretically that the two measures follow similar trend for a changing graph, i.e., as the edge density of a graph increases its sparsity index decreases. Additionally, the paper draws a relationship, analytically, between the sparsity index and the exponent term of a power law distribution, a distribution which is known to approximate the degree distribution of a wide variety of network graphs. Finally, the article highlights how the proposed index together with Gini index can reveal important properties of a network graph.},

In the present paper we have carried out a principal component analysis ({PCA}) of 90 topological parameters derived from 3692 distinct chemicals taken from an environmental database consisting of nearly nineteen thousand compounds. The {PCA} using the correlation matrix resulted in 10 principal components ({PC}'s) with eigenvalues greater than 1. These ten {PC}'s explained over 92\% of the variance in the standardized data. The first four {PC}'s explained over 78\% of the variance and the interpretations of these four {PC}'s is given in terms of the chemical structures at the extremes of these {PC}'s.},

  abstract     = {Many papers published in recent years show that real-world graphs G(n,m) (n nodes, m edges) are more or less “complex” in the sense that different topological features deviate from random graphs. Here we narrow the definition of graph complexity and argue that a complex graph contains many different subgraphs. We present different measures that quantify this complexity, for instance C1e, the relative number of non-isomorphic one-edge-deleted subgraphs (i.e. {DECK} size). However, because these different subgraph measures are computationally demanding, we also study simpler complexity measures focussing on slightly different aspects of graph complexity. We consider heuristically defined “product measures”, the products of two quantities which are zero in the extreme cases of a path and clique, and “entropy measures” quantifying the diversity of different topological features. The previously defined network/graph complexity measures Medium Articulation and Offdiagonal complexity ({OdC}) belong to these two classes. We study {OdC} measures in some detail and compare it with our new measures. For all measures, the most complex graph {GCmax} has a medium number of edges, between the edge numbers of the minimum and the maximum connected graph n−1{\textless}m({GCmax}){\textless}n(n−1)/2. Interestingly, for some measures C̃ this number scales exactly with the geometric mean of the extremes: m({GC}̃max)=n/2(n−1)∼n1.5. All graph complexity measures are characterized with the help of different example graphs. For all measures the corresponding time complexity is given. Finally, we discuss the complexity of 33 real-world graphs of different biological, social and economic systems with the six computationally most simple measures (including {OdC}). The complexities of the real graphs are compared with average complexities of two different random graph versions: complete random graphs (just fixed n,m) and rewired graphs with fixed node degrees.},

The graph entropy measures are playing an important role in a variety of problem areas including, discrete mathematics, biology, and chemistry. Our contribution is to explore graph entropies that are based on a novel information functional, which is the number of vertices of different degree together with the number of edges between different degree vertices. In this paper, we study the chemical graph of crystal structure of titanium difluoride {TiF}2 and crystallographic structure of cuprite Cu2O. Also, we compute entropies of these structures by making a relation of degree based topological indices namely first redefined Zagreb index, second redefined Zagreb index, third redefined Zagreb index, fourth Atom Bond Connectivity index, fifth Geometric Arithmetic index, Sanskruti index with the help of information function.},

Some calculation results on the Wiener complexity and the Wiener index of fullerene graphs of order     n ≤ 232     and IPR fullerene graphs of order     n ≤ 270     are presented. The structure of graphs with the maximal Wiener complexity or the maximal Wiener index is discussed, and formulas for the Wiener index of several families of graphs are obtained.},

The chemicals are accessible in different ways (CAS, SMILES, names and so forth) and their three-dimensional structure can be visualized. Some of the QSAR models, previously published by our group, have been redeveloped using the free online software for molecular descriptor calculation, PaDEL-Descriptor. The new models can be easily applied for future predictions on chemicals without experimental data, also verifying the applicability domain to new chemicals. The QSAR model reporting format (QMRF) of these models is also here downloadable.

The concept of QSAR has typically been used for drug discovery and development and has gained wide applicability for correlating molecular information with not only biological activities but also with other physicochemical properties, which has therefore been termed quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR). Typical molecular parameters that are used to account for electronic properties, hydrophobicity, steric effects, and topology can be determined empirically through experimentation or theoretically via computational chemistry. A given compilation of data sets is then subjected to data pre-processing and data modeling through the use of statistical and/or machine learning techniques. This review aims to cover the essential concepts and techniques that are relevant for performing QSAR/QSPR studies through the use of selected examples from our previous work.},

Boston starting chains reach the target person with fewer intermediaries than those starting in Nebraska; subpopulations in the Nebraska group do not differ among themselves.

A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature was found to be a consequence of two generic mechanisms: (i) networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and (ii) new vertices attach preferentially to sites that are already well connected. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.},

  abstract = {Mapping the detailed connectivity patterns (connectomes) of neural circuits is a central goal of neuroscience. The best quantitative approach to analyzing connectome data is still unclear but graph theory has been used with success. We present a graph theoretical model of the posterior lateral line sensorimotor pathway in zebrafish. The model includes 2,616 neurons and 167,114 synaptic connections. Model neurons represent known cell types in zebrafish larvae, and connections were set stochastically following rules based on biological literature. Thus, our model is a uniquely detailed computational representation of a vertebrate connectome. The connectome has low overall connection density, with 2.45\% of all possible connections, a value within the physiological range. We used graph theoretical tools to compare the zebrafish connectome graph to small-world, random and structured random graphs of the same size. For each type of graph, 100 randomly generated instantiations were considered. Degree distribution (the number of connections per neuron) varied more in the zebrafish graph than in same size graphs with less biological detail. There was high local clustering and a short average path length between nodes, implying a small-world structure similar to other neural connectomes and complex networks. The graph was found not to be scale-free, in agreement with some other neural connectomes. An experimental lesion was performed that targeted three model brain neurons, including the Mauthner neuron, known to control fast escape turns. The lesion decreased the number of short paths between sensory and motor neurons analogous to the behavioral effects of the same lesion in zebrafish. This model is expandable and can be used to organize and interpret a growing database of information on the zebrafish connectome.},

This paper presents a new, comprehensive, system-wide approach to identifying critical links and evaluating network performance. The approach considers network flows, link capacity and network topology. Moreover, it relies on readily available sources of data. Using three hypothetical networks, we demonstrate that the approach, known as the Network Robustness Index, yields different highway planning solutions than the traditional V/C ratio. Moreover, these solutions yield far greater system-wide benefits, as measured by travel-time savings, than solutions identified by the V/C ratio.},

The learnt patch representations summarize subgraphs centered around nodes of interest, and can thus be reused for downstream node-wise learning tasks. In contrast to most prior approaches to unsupervised learning with GCNs, DGI does not rely on random walk objectives, and is readily applicable to both transductive and inductive learning setups.

Yet, it has not achieved competitive performance on popular leaderboards of graph-level prediction compared to mainstream GNN variants. Therefore, it remains a mystery how Transformers could perform well for graph representation learning. In this paper, we solve this mystery by presenting Graphormer, which is built upon the standard Transformer architecture, and could attain excellent results on a broad range of graph representation learning tasks, especially on the recent OGB Large-Scale Challenge. Our key insight to utilizing Transformer in the graph is the necessity of effectively encoding the structural information of a graph into the model. To this end, we propose several simple yet effective structural encoding methods to help Graphormer better model graph-structured data. Besides, we mathematically characterize the expressive power of Graphormer and exhibit that with our ways of encoding the structural information of graphs, many popular GNN variants could be covered as the special cases of Graphormer.},

  abstract   = {Low-rank matrix approximations, such as the truncated singular value decomposition and the rank-revealing QR decomposition, play a central role in data analysis and scientific computing. This work surveys and extends recent research which demonstrates that randomization offers a powerful tool for performing low-rank matrix approximation. These techniques exploit modern computational architectures more fully than classical methods and open the possibility of dealing with truly massive data sets. This paper presents a modular framework for constructing randomized algorithms that compute partial matrix decompositions. These methods use random sampling to identify a subspace that captures most of the action of a matrix. The input matrix is then compressed—either explicitly or implicitly—to this subspace, and the reduced matrix is manipulated deterministically to obtain the desired low-rank factorization. In many cases, this approach beats its classical competitors in terms of accuracy, robustness, and/or speed. These claims are supported by extensive numerical experiments and a detailed error analysis. The specific benefits of randomized techniques depend on the computational environment. Consider the model problem of finding the k dominant components of the singular value decomposition of an 
                m×n
                m×n
                matrix. (i) For a dense input matrix, randomized algorithms require 
                {\textbackslash}bigO(mnlog(k))
                {\textbackslash}bigO(mnlog⁡(k))
                floating-point operations (flops) in contrast to 
                {\textbackslash}bigO(mnk)
                {\textbackslash}bigO(mnk)
                for classical algorithms. (ii) For a sparse input matrix, the flop count matches classical Krylov subspace methods, but the randomized approach is more robust and can easily be reorganized to exploit multiprocessor architectures. (iii) For a matrix that is too large to fit in fast memory, the randomized techniques require only a constant number of passes over the data, as opposed to 
                {\textbackslash}bigO(k)
                {\textbackslash}bigO(k)
                passes for classical algorithms. In fact, it is sometimes possible to perform matrix approximation with a single pass over the data.},

  abstract  = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

  abstract  = {We propose a recipe on how to build a general, powerful, scalable (GPS) graph Transformer with linear complexity and state-of-the-art results on a diverse set of benchmarks. Graph Transformers (GTs) have gained popularity in the field of graph representation learning with a variety of recent publications but they lack a common foundation about what constitutes a good positional or structural encoding, and what differentiates them. In this paper, we summarize the different types of encodings with a clearer definition and categorize them as being \${\textbackslash}textit\{local\}\$, \${\textbackslash}textit\{global\}\$ or \${\textbackslash}textit\{relative\}\$. The prior GTs are constrained to small graphs with a few hundred nodes, here we propose the first architecture with a complexity linear in the number of nodes and edges \$O(N+E)\$ by decoupling the local real-edge aggregation from the fully-connected Transformer. We argue that this decoupling does not negatively affect the expressivity, with our architecture being a universal function approximator on graphs. Our GPS recipe consists of choosing 3 main ingredients: (i) positional/structural encoding, (ii) local message-passing mechanism, and (iii) global attention mechanism. We provide a modular framework \${\textbackslash}textit\{GraphGPS\}\$ that supports multiple types of encodings and that provides efficiency and scalability both in small and large graphs. We test our architecture on 16 benchmarks and show highly competitive results in all of them, show-casing the empirical benefits gained by the modularity and the combination of different strategies.},

  abstract  = {We propose a generalization of transformer neural network architecture for arbitrary graphs. The original transformer was designed for Natural Language Processing (NLP), which operates on fully connected graphs representing all connections between the words in a sequence. Such architecture does not leverage the graph connectivity inductive bias, and can perform poorly when the graph topology is important and has not been encoded into the node features. We introduce a graph transformer with four new properties compared to the standard model. First, the attention mechanism is a function of the neighborhood connectivity for each node in the graph. Second, the positional encoding is represented by the Laplacian eigenvectors, which naturally generalize the sinusoidal positional encodings often used in NLP. Third, the layer normalization is replaced by a batch normalization layer, which provides faster training and better generalization performance. Finally, the architecture is extended to edge feature representation, which can be critical to tasks s.a. chemistry (bond type) or link prediction (entity relationship in knowledge graphs). Numerical experiments on a graph benchmark demonstrate the performance of the proposed graph transformer architecture. This work closes the gap between the original transformer, which was designed for the limited case of line graphs, and graph neural networks, that can work with arbitrary graphs. As our architecture is simple and generic, we believe it can be used as a black box for future applications that wish to consider transformer and graphs.},

Here we present GraphSAGE, a general, inductive framework that leverages node feature information (e.g., text attributes) to efficiently generate node embeddings for previously unseen data. Instead of training individual embeddings for each node, we learn a function that generates embeddings by sampling and aggregating features from a node's local neighborhood. Our algorithm outperforms strong baselines on three inductive node-classification benchmarks: we classify the category of unseen nodes in evolving information graphs based on citation and Reddit post data, and we show that our algorithm generalizes to completely unseen graphs using a multi-graph dataset of protein-protein interactions.},

Many GNN variants have been proposed and have achieved state-of-the-art results on both node and graph classification tasks. However, despite GNNs revolutionizing graph representation learning, there is limited understanding of their representational properties and limitations. Here, we present a theoretical framework for analyzing the expressive power of GNNs to capture different graph structures. Our results characterize the discriminative power of popular GNN variants, such as Graph Convolutional Networks and GraphSAGE, and show that they cannot learn to distinguish certain simple graph structures. We then develop a simple architecture that is provably the most expressive among the class of GNNs and is as powerful as the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test. We empirically validate our theoretical findings on a number of graph classification benchmarks, and demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

  abstract   = {Concepts taken from graph theory and other branches of topology have been used by many sociologists and social psychologists, in particular Kurt Lewin and J. L. Moreno. Similar ideas have been used to construct statistical models of nervous systems, and these have been applied by J. S. Coleman and others to the spread of information and other social phenomena. The study of social networks by anthropologists has been based, knowingly or unknowingly, on the basic notions of graph theory, as has the identification and analysis of social cliques. There is little consensus among mathematicians about terminology, and social scientists have drawn fortuitously on various mathematical vocabularies as well as inventing their own technical terms. Applied to social networks, the words `connectedness' and `connectivity' may refer to properties of the distance between persons, the number of paths between them, whether there is a path at all, or the proportion of possible paths actually in existence. These different usages are contrasted by restating them all in the terminology set out in Structural models (1965) by Harary, Norman and Cartwright.},

  abstract = {The numerical encoding of chemical structure with Topological Indices (TIs) is currently growing in importance in Medicinal Chemistry and Bioinformatics. This approach allows the rapid collection, annotation, retrieval, comparison and mining of chemical structures within large databases. TIs can subsequently be used to seek quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR), which are models connecting chemical structure with biological activity. In the early 1990's, there was an explosion in the introduction and definition of new TIs. The Handbook of Molecular Descriptors by Todeschini and Consonni lists more than 1500 of these indices. At the end of the last century, researchers produced a large number of TIs with essentially the same advantages and/or disadvantages. Consequently, many researchers abandoned the definition of TIs for a time. In our opinion, one of the problems associated with TIs is that researchers aimed their efforts only at the codification of chemical connectivity for small-sized drugs. As a consequence, recently it seems that we have arrived at "Fukuyama's End of History in TIs definition". In the work described here, we review and comment on the "quo vadis" and challenges in the definition of TIs as we enter the new century. Emphasis is placed on new chiral TIs (CTIs), flexible TIs for unifying QSAR models with multiple targets, topographic indices (TPGIs), TIs for DNA and protein sequences, TIs for 2D RNA structures, TPGIs and drug-protein or drug-RNA quantitative structure-binding relationship (QSBR) studies, TIs to encode protein surface information and TIs for protein interaction networks (PINs).},

The Third Edition begins with a general introduction to nonlinear programming with illustrative examples and guidelines for model construction. Concentration on the three major parts of nonlinear programming is provided:  Convex analysis with discussion of topological properties of convex sets, separation and support of convex sets, polyhedral sets, extreme points and extreme directions of polyhedral sets, and linear programming Optimality conditions and duality with coverage of the nature, interpretation, and value of the classical Fritz John (FJ) and the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions; the interrelationships between various proposed constraint qualifications; and Lagrangian duality and saddle point optimality conditions Algorithms and their convergence, with a presentation of algorithms for solving both unconstrained and constrained nonlinear programming problems  Important features of the Third Edition include:  New topics such as second interior point methods, nonconvex optimization, nondifferentiable optimization, and more Updated discussion and new applications in each chapter Detailed numerical examples and graphical illustrations Essential coverage of modeling and formulating nonlinear programs Simple numerical problems Advanced theoretical exercises  The book is a solid reference for professionals as well as a useful text for students in the fields of operations research, management science, industrial engineering, applied mathematics, and also in engineering disciplines that deal with analytical optimization techniques. The logical and self-contained format uniquely covers nonlinear programming techniques with a great depth of information and an abundance of valuable examples and illustrations that showcase the most current advances in nonlinear problems.},

Given a dataset containing graphs in the form of (G, y) where G is a graph and y is its class, we aim to develop neural networks that read the graphs directly and learn a classiﬁcation function. There are two main challenges: 1 how to extract useful features characterizing the rich information encoded in a graph for classification purpose, and 2 how to sequentially read a graph in a meaningful and consistent order. To address the first challenge, we design a localized graph convolution model and show its connection with two graph kernels. To address the second challenge, we design a novel SortPooling layer which sorts graph vertices in a consistent order so that traditional neural networks can be trained on the graphs. Experiments on benchmark graph classiﬁcation datasets demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves highly competitive performance with state-of-the-art graph kernels and other graph neural network methods. Moreover, the architecture allows end-to-end gradient-based training with original graphs, without the need to first transform graphs into vectors.},

As a first step, we characterize switching equivalence and balance of gain graphs in terms of their adjacency matrices in \$M\_n({\textbackslash}mathbb C G)\$. Then we introduce a represented adjacency matrix, associated with a gain graph and a group representation, by extending the theory of Fourier transforms from the group algebra \${\textbackslash}mathbb C G\$ to the algebra \$M\_n({\textbackslash}mathbb C G)\$. We prove that a gain graph is balanced if and only if the spectrum of the represented adjacency matrix associated with any (or equivalently all) faithful unitary representation of \$G\$ coincides with the spectrum of the underlying graph, with multiplicity given by the degree of the representation. We show that the complex adjacency matrix of unit gain graphs and the adjacency matrix of a cover graph are indeed particular cases of our construction. This enables us to recover some classical results and prove some new characterizations of balance in terms of spectrum, index or structure of these graphs.},

Bollobás and Erdös generalized this index by replacing −1/2 with any real number α, which is called the general Randić index.

Based on this, recently, Knor et al. introduced two generalizations: Rα′(G)=∑uv∈E(G)min\{duα,dvα\}andRα′′(G)=∑uv∈E(G)max\{duα,dvα\},for any real number α. Clearly, the former is a lower bound for the general Randić index, and the latter is its upper bound. Knor et al. studied extremal values of Rα′(G) and Rα′′(G) and concluded some open problems. In this paper, we consider the open problems and give some comments and results. Some results for chemical trees are obtained.},

In particular, our aim is to study their performance when applying such quantitative network measures to disease networks (prostate cancer versus benign tissue), i.e., graphs inferred from biological data sets based on different conditions of prostate cancer. The networks we have inferred are from public available micro array studies. Different kinds of topological graph measures (non-information-theoretic and information- theoretic) are calculated with a subsequently performed cluster analysis. We analyze different sets of descriptors and come to quite reasonable results when clustering between the different conditions of the disease.},

We test several {SVMs} that use different similarity metrics, as well as some other supervised learning methods, and find that the {SVMs} best identify sets of genes with a common function using expression data. Finally, we use {SVMs} to predict functional roles for uncharacterized yeast {ORFs} based on their expression data.},

For graph data, a whole toolbox of data mining algorithms becomes available by deﬁning a kernel function on instances of graphs. Graph kernels based on walks, subtrees and cycles in graphs have been proposed so far. As a general problem, these kernels are either computationally expensive or limited in their expressiveness. We try to overcome this problem by deﬁning expressive graph kernels which are based on paths. As the computation of all paths and longest paths in a graph is {NP}-hard, we propose graph kernels based on shortest paths. These kernels are computable in polynomial time, retain expressivity and are still positive deﬁnite. In experiments on classiﬁcation of graph models of proteins, our shortest-path kernels show signiﬁcantly higher classiﬁcation accuracy than walk-based kernels.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

  abstract     = {A novel topological index for the characterization of chemical graphs, derived from the reciprocal distance matrix and named the Harary index in honor of Professor Frank Harary, has been introduced. The Harary index is not a unique molecular descriptor; the smallest pair of the alkane trees with identical Harary indices has been detected in the octane family. The use of the Harary index in the quantitative structure-property relationships is exemplified in modeling physical properties of the C2-C9 alkanes. In this application, the performance of the Harary index is comparable to the performance of the Wiener number.},

In this paper, we study how the harmonic index behaves when the graph is under perturbations. These results are used to provide a simpler method for determining the unicyclic graphs with maximum and minimum harmonic index among all unicyclic graphs, respectively. Moreover, a lower bound for harmonic index is also obtained.},
